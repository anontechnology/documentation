# Report-Only Data

## POST /report
Records activity for report-only data; that is, data that is not stored in the vault but is still being monitored. The purpose of this endpoint is to collect metadata about how sensitive data that is stored in external systems is being used.

While writes of external data can be recorded using [the same API endpoint used for storing data in the vault](/api/datapoints#post-datasubjectssubjectidattributes), this endpoint allows recording reads and deletes as well as writes.

### Parameters

#### Body Parameters (Required)
|Name            |Type                            |Description                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|payload         |List of ExternalActivityEvent   |List of accesses to externally-stored data|

The structure of the ExternalActivityEvent object is as follows:

|Name |Type |Description|Usage|
|-----|-----|-----------|-----|
|eventType|String|One of "read", "store", "delete", or "update".|Required|
|dataPointId|String|Unique identifier for the attribute being accessed. This can be an identifier that is created externally or one that is generated by ViziVault.|Optional for `"store"` events (a new data point ID will be generated by ViziVault in this case); required for other events.|
|subjectId|String|Unique identifier for the data subject whom this attribute belongs to|Required for `"store"` events; optional for other events as it can be derived from the data point id.|
|data|[Attribute](/glossary/attribute)|The attribute being saved for a `"store"` or `"update"` event.|For `"store"` events, `attribute` is required and all other fields that would be used when storing data in the vault are optional. For `"update"` events, `value` is optional. Other fields are ignored. If a value is supplied, it will be used by the [rules engine](/tutorials/rules) but it will **not** be stored.|
|timestamp|Date|The time at which the access occurred. If not specified, the current time will be assumed.|Optional|
|applicationId|String|Unique identifier for the application that was used to initiate this access.|Required|
|applicationUser|String|Identifier for the application user who initiated this access.|Optional|
|location|Geolocation|The geographic country, subdivision, and/or city where this access was initiated from.|Optional|
