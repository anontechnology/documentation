# Overview

Vizivault Enterprise allows organizations to visualize, manage, and share personal information. 

## Visualization
Vizivault Enterprise gives your organization a window into the personal information you already have, how it is being used, and what risks are associated with it. It shows you what personal information you have shared within and external to your organization. You can show the quantity of information that is not properly secured.

- **Dashboard** gives you an overview of the security of your information with a focus on immediate security concerns and overall information health.
- **Discover** allows you to examine your data more closely, viewing trends over time, geographical distribution by country, and other statistics.
- **Reports** creates custom reports tailored to your organization's needs, which will alert you to anomalous usage of your stored data.

## Management

Vizivault Enterprise can also let you control and manage your organization's personal information. You can define attributes to specify what kinds of data you store, and regulations that control how data is used.

- **Tags** Create tags that can mark and categorize attributes, data subjects, or individual points of data.
- **Attributes** Create the fundamental data types that your organization needs to store and define how they are handled.
- **Regulations** Create rules to manage personal information across your organization.
- **Applications** Define which programs have access to which attributes.

<!--## Distribution

Vizivault Enterprise has specific controls to manage where data is stored in our vault network and who you share data with.

- **Data Sharing** Share data with other organizations. Control what gets shared and how often.
- **Vaults** Manage your personal data repositories.-->
