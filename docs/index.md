# Overview
The ViziVault Platform is the first comprehensive PrivSec (privacy/security) solution on the market today.

We aim to empower engineers to easily control access to their customer's sensitive private information and provide tools to help visualize and contextualize the usage of private information.

## ViziVault API

The ViziVault API is designed to enable you as a developer to store and retrieve personal/sensitive information in a safe and secure manner that is easy to use. The multi layer encryption/decryption will prevent even you as a developer from accessing certain pieces of an end users personal information. This is meant to provide users with the greatest flexibility on the security of their data.

## ViziVault Enterprise

ViziVault Enterprise is an aggregated view of the personal information stored using the ViziVault API for a companyâ€™s users, highlighting risks, accessibility to, and the composition of governed data. Here, companies can take action to reduce data privacy risks down to desired levels and monitor risk levels in real-time.
