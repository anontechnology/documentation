Our platform and suite of connectors/tools makes it easy for you to stream sensitive data from various sources into secure storage using military-grade encryption through our [ViziVault API](#vizivault-api).

## The Platform

### ViziVault API

The ViziVault API enables you to store, retrieve and manage personal/sensitive information in a safe and secure manner.

The multi-layer encryption/decryption will allow you to manage access to end users personal information. You can allow access to individual users to different users, access group, or even from certain applications. You can also reveal a end-user's personal data in whole or in part keeping the use of personal information tied to your company's workflows and business goals.

This is meant to provide users with the greatest flexibility on the security of their data. You have the capability to maximize your usage of collectesd personal data without unessecary exposuere of sensitve data. You have the maximum flexability and capability to meet and exceed personal data regulatory requirements.

### ViziVault Enterprise

ViziVault Enterprise is an aggregated view of the personal information stored using the ViziVault API for a companyâ€™s users, showing the accessibility and composition of governed data.

Here, companies can take action to reduce data privacy risks down to desired levels and monitor risk levels in real-time.

## Deployment Models
The ViziVault Platform aims to eliminate any risk of malicious intrusions by hacks and exploits alike by enforcing encryption for data in transit and in persistence.

Carefully designed, we eliminate the threat of having your organization's data leaked publicly on the internet.

Our organization has no desire and does not wish to analyze your sensitive data in any manner and internally hold strict protocols and standards to ensure that your data is always secure.

Although we take extra precautions, we completely understand that streaming data to our platform may not be in compliance with some company policies and standards.

As a result, we offer an alternative option to host our lightweight API in your own infrastrucutre and network to ensure that it is impossible for Anontech to decrypt or view your data (think of it like a proxy).

### On-Premise
Our On-Premise option places our Vault API behind your firewall for added security to ensure that it is strictly prohibited that any unencrypted data can be read by an external party (including us).

Our architecture is container-ready and can be deployed to fit your needs with all security best-practices baked-in.

Streaming back to our platform, you maintain rich insights and powerful control to enable your users and customers to take control of their data with full-transparency.
