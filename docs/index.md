Easily grant access to trusted applications to limit the scope of who and what can query your data using [ViziVault Enterprise](#vizivault-enterprise).

## ViziVault API

The ViziVault API is designed to enable you as a developer to store and retrieve personal/sensitive information in a safe and secure manner that is easy to use. The multi-layer encryption/decryption will prevent even you as a developer from accessing certain pieces of an end users personal information. This is meant to provide users with the greatest flexibility on the security of their data.

## ViziVault Enterprise

ViziVault Enterprise is an aggregated view of the personal information stored using the ViziVault API for a companyâ€™s users, showing the accessibility and composition of governed data. Here, companies can take action to reduce data privacy risks down to desired levels and monitor risk levels in real-time.
